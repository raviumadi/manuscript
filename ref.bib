	abstract = {In the last three decades, the Steered Response Power (SRP) method has been widely used for the task of Sound Source Localization (SSL), due to its satisfactory localization performance on moderately reverberant and noisy scenarios. Many works have analysed and extended the original SRP method to reduce its computational cost, to allow it to locate multiple sources, or to improve its performance in adverse environments. In this work, we review over 200 papers on the SRP method and its variants, with emphasis on the SRP-PHAT method. We also present eXtensible-SRP, or X-SRP, a generalized and modularized version of the SRP algorithm which allows the reviewed extensions to be implemented. We provide a Python implementation of the algorithm which includes selected extensions from the literature.},

	abstract = {Some parameters of echolocation signals can be studied using a single receiver. However, studying parameters such as source level, echolocation beam shape, and direction of signal emission require the use of multireceiver arrays. Acoustic localization allows for determination of the position of bats at the time of signal emission. When multiple animals are present, calls can be assigned to individuals based on their location. This combination makes large multireceiver arrays a powerful tool in bioacoustics research. Here, an overview of different array configurations used to record bats in the field is presented. In some studies, the absolute position of bats and not only relative to the array is crucial. Combining acoustic localizations from a source with geo-referenced receivers allows for determining geo-referenced movements of bats. Current applications of arrays aim to improve acoustic monitoring of bats and study anthropogenic impact},

	abstract = {A method is presented for localizing acoustic sources using an array of sensors, the output of each being a vector consisting of the acoustic pressure and acoustic particle velocity. The authors derive a compact expression for the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) on the estimation errors of the source direction-of-arrival (DOA) parameters in the multi-source multi-vector-sensor model. An explicit expression is found for the mean-square angular error (MSAE) bound for source localization with a single vector sensor. The authors present two simple algorithms for estimating the source DOA with this sensor, along with their statistical performance analyses.{$<>$}},

	abstract = {Animal locations are sometimes estimated by measuring the difference in travel times of their sounds at pairs of receivers. Ideally, each difference specifies the animal's location to a hyperboloid, and sufficient numbers of intersecting hyperboloids specify the location. Most bioacoustic publications state that one needs three receivers to locate animals in two spatial dimensions and four receivers in three spatial dimensions. However, the actual numbers of receivers required for locations in two and three dimensions are four and five, respectively. Significant location errors can result from using insufficient numbers of receivers. Methods are provided for determining locations of ambiguous source-location regions.},

	abstract = {Acoustic vector-sensors (AVS) have been designed using the P-P method for different microphone configurations. These configurations have been used to project the acoustic intensity on the orthogonal axes through which the direction of arrival (DoA) of a sound source has been estimated. The analytical expressions for the DoA for different microphone configurations have been derived for two-dimensional geometry. Finite element method simulation using COMSOL-Multiphysics has been performed, where the microphone signals for AVS configurations have been recorded in free field conditions. The performance of all the configurations has been evaluated with respect to angular error and root-mean-square angular error. The simulation results obtained with ideal geometry for different configurations have been corroborated experimentally with prototype AVS realizations and also compared with microphone-array method, viz., Multiple Signal Classification and Generalized Cross Correlation. Experiments have been performed in an anechoic room using different prototype AVS configurations made from small size microphones. The DoA performance using analytical expressions, simulation studies, and experiments with prototype AVS in anechoic chamber are presented in the paper. The square and delta configurations are found to perform better in the absence and presence of noise, respectively.},
